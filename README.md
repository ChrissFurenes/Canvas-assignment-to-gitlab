# Canvas-assignment-to-gitlab
I made this integratin to get my assignments in Canvas to my gitlab repo, every assignments is importes to gitlab as a issue with a milestone tag and tag. It imports name, context and due date to all assignments.

If the assignments is allredy imported to gitlab as a issue, it wil ignore it. (it just checks the name)
